# K-Sidekick

K-sidekick is a set of projects that compliment Kafka. They are targetted towards edge computing and embedded projects. The purpose of the projects are to provide high-throughput and extreemly low latency stream processing. 

The sidekick part is because K-Sidekick is just meant as a way to perform computations closer to the hardware in a kafka like fashion and provide seamless interoperability with Kafka in such a way that you can perform a computation on the edge and ship data to a kafka topic on the cloud or another cluster.
